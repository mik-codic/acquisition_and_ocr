This repository shows how to use the TIS camera with the TIS.py library. The main script incorporates the usage of the Halcon library to run the DeepOcr for recognizing text in the image.

To run the script, simply run:
```bash
$ python main.py
```
the program will initialize the camera and prompt the user to insert an input for acquiring the images.
